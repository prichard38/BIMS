# BIMS - CS 490 Capstone Fall 2021
## Web Application

#### This guide is meant to assist in setting up the development environment for the BIMS web application and serve as a reference for project structure, file descriptions, and general helpful information.

##### *NOTE: The BIMS web application is an ongoing project still in development.* 

##### The Fall 2021 Capstone team contribution includes database integration, creation of distinct user roles(admin, inspector, and supervisor), implementation of the login process for each role, and implementation of Report Management features for the supervisor role, including the Yearly Inspection Report Tool and the Longitudinal Analysis Tool.
--------------------------------------------------------
### Development Environment Setup

#### Setting up your local environment:
1. Install XAMPP Version 7.4.23 or above. Download: https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html  (* *Note that XAMPP contains the database administration tool, phpMyAdmin, for MariaDB and MySQL.*)
2. Install Visual Studio Code. Download: https://code.visualstudio.com/download

###### XAMPP FAQs:
* Mac: https://www.apachefriends.org/faq_osx.html
* Windows: https://www.apachefriends.org/faq_windows.html

###### Visual Studio Code Installation Manual:
* Mac: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac 
* Windows: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/windows

#### Installation of the BIMS Codebase on your local machine (Mac):
1. Download the source code ZIP file from GitHub: https://github.com/prichard38/BIMS
2. Open XAMPP
3. In  **[General]** tab of XAMPP panel, click **[Start]** button.
4. In  **[Services]** tab of XAMPP panel, select *Apache* and click **[Start]**. Then select *MySQL* and click **[Start]**.
5. In **[Network]** tab of XAMPP panel, select **[localhost:8080->80(OverSSH)]** and
click **[Enable]** button.
6. In **[Volumes]** tab of XAMPP panel, click **[Mount]** button.
7. Un-compress the source code zip file, `BIMS-main`, in XAMPPâ€™s `htdocs` directory (usual folder path: `/opt/lampp/htdocs`). If you cannot find the folder, click the **[Explore]** button in the **[Volumes]** tab of XAMPP panel. You will be moved to `lampp` directory and can find the `htdocs` folder.
8. Now you are ready to use it. You can access the web application by typing in the web browser http://localhost:8080/BIMS-main/login.php (The port number 8080 may be different depending on the MAMP setting.)

#### Installation of the BIMS Codebase on your local machine (Windows):

#### Installation of the BIMS Database on your local machine:
1. With XAMPP services started (see steps above), navigate to phpMyAdmin in your web browser by entering the url `localhost8080/dashboard`, or just simply `localhost8080`, then clicking on **[phpMyAdmin]** in the top nav bar.
2. Inside phpMyAdmin, click on **[Import]** in the top nav bar.
3. Click the **[Choose File]** button. Navigate to the directory `/opt/lampp/htdocs/BIMS-main/SQL` and select the file `BIMSdb.sql` to attach.
4. Click the **[Go]** button. This will build your database structure, add stored procedures (routines), and fill it with test data.


Now you may open the directory `/opt/lampp/htdocs/BIMS-main` in Visual Studio Code and begin development. Saved changes in source code will be immediately viewable on browser page load/reload.
