## Web Application - Report Management for Supervisors

##### The Report Management features in this web application allow supervisors to view compiled bridge inspection report data. There are two main Report Management features: the Yearly Inspection Report Tool and the Logitudinal Analysis Tool. 

##### The Yearly Inspection Report Tool provides a summary of all bridge inspection data for the selected year. 

##### The Longitudinal Analysis Tool provides a breakdown of bridge inspection data over a given timeframe of up to 10 years, with visual line chart representations of inspection ratings and the ability to compare up to three bridges simultaneously.
